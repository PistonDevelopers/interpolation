//! Interpolation algorithms.
//!
//! Interpolation is used in animation, 
//! to describe smooth shapes and to make transitions.
//! Any object that fullfill certain mathematical 
//! properties can be interpolated.
//! A common technique is using one ore more 'numbers' 
//! controlling the mixture of states.
//! The choice of interpolation algorithm depends often 
//! on the circumstances where it used.

/// A linear interpolation consists of two states 'a' and 'b'.

/// gives weight to 'a' or 'b'.
/// When 't' is zero then 'a' has full weight.
/// When 't' is one then 'b' has full weight.
